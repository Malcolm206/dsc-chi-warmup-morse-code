# Decode Morse Code

This morning we will be writing a function to translate a poem that has been encoded with morse code.

**Import modules**


```python
# os is used to create file paths
import os
# pickle is used to import data files
import pickle
# test package
from test_scripts.test_class import Test
```

**In the cell below, we import the encoded poem.**


```python
path_to_poem = os.path.join('data', 'morseCode.pkl')
with open(path_to_poem, 'rb') as file:
    data = pickle.load(file)
```

**Let's take a look at the first line of the poem**


```python
data[0]
```




    '- .... ./--.. . -./--- ..-./.--. -.-- - .... --- -. --..--/-... -.--/- .. --/.--. . - . .-. .../'



**A dictionary of morse code mapping is imported below.**


```python
# Import decode dictionary
decode_path = os.path.join('data', 'morseMappings.pkl')
with open(decode_path, 'rb') as file:
    decode = pickle.load(file)

print(decode)
```

    {'.-': 'A', '-...': 'B', '-.-.': 'C', '-..': 'D', '.': 'E', '..-.': 'F', '--.': 'G', '....': 'H', '..': 'I', '.---': 'J', '-.-': 'K', '.-..': 'L', '--': 'M', '-.': 'N', '---': 'O', '.--.': 'P', '--.-': 'Q', '.-.': 'R', '...': 'S', '-': 'T', '..-': 'U', '...-': 'V', '.--': 'W', '-..-': 'X', '-.--': 'Y', '--..': 'Z', '.----': '1', '..---': '2', '...--': '3', '....-': '4', '.....': '5', '-....': '6', '--...': '7', '---..': '8', '----.': '9', '-----': '0', '--..--': ',', '.-.-.-': '.', '..--..': '?', '-..-.': '/', '-....-': '-', '-.--.': '(', '-.--.-': ')', '-.-.--': '!', '.----.': "'", '---...': ':', '.-...': '&'}


**The keys of this dictionary are morse code and the values are english characters.**

To translate the poem, we simply have to feed each encoded letter into the dictionary as a key, and we will receive their decoded values.

*Important information:*

>The encoded poem uses a forward slash ```'/'``` to seperate words and a space ```' '``` to seperate each letter.

Using the ```decode``` dictionary, please build a function that can translate the poem from morse code to english sentences.

<u>To do this, the function should:</u>
1. Receive a single encoded string called ```morse_code```.
2. Split the encoded string using ```'/'``` as a seperator.
3. Loop over the list of encoded words.
4. Split a given word using ```' '``` as a seperator.
5. Loop over each letter in a given word.
6. Feed the letter into the ```decode``` dictionary as a key.
7. Append each decoded letter to a string
8. Append each decoded word to a string with spaces between each word
9. No spaces should be present at the beginning or the end of a decoded sentence. 


```python
def decode_morse(morse_code):
    decoded = ''
    words = morse_code.split('/')
    for word in words:
        letters = word.split()
        length = len(letters)
        for idx in range(length):
            letter = letters[idx]
            if letter in decode.keys():
                decoded += decode[letter]
            if idx == length - 1:
                decoded += ' '
    decoded = decoded.strip()
    return decoded       
```

<u><b>Run the cell below to test your function!</b></u>


```python
test = Test()
poem = [decode_morse(line) for line in data]
test.run_test(poem, 'poem')
```


✅ **Hey, you did it.  Good job.**


### Now, let's test our function against the entire play ```The Tragedy of Julius Caesar```


```python
# Import encoded data
with open('data/juliusCaesarEncoded.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    caesar = pickle.load(file)

# Run our function on every line of the play    
decoded_caesar = [decode_morse(line) for line in caesar]

# Test the results!
test.run_test(decoded_caesar, 'caesar')
```


✅ **Hey, you did it.  Good job.**


# Enjoy Mod 3 :)
